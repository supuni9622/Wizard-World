		Diagon Alley
		
		Diagon Alley is the main wizarding shopping street in London.On this street we can find any number of shops specifically for wizards,
		including
		
				Eeylops Owl Emporium:
				which is a store specializing in owls and suppliers for them,which of course serve both as pets and as well as a means of
				communications in the Wizarding world.
				
				Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour:which actually sounds like a nice place for Muddles as well
				
				Flourish & Blotts Bookstore: is so overloaded with spell books that it apparently takes magic to keep its shelves from tipping 
				over.
				
				Gringotts Wizarding Bank: is the one place where Wizard's Keep their money.And you also can deposit your money there.
				
				Knockturn Alley
				
				Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions:si a shop selling wizard's robes,school uniforms,and general wizard wear.

				The Leaky Cauldron pub:which serves as the gateway to Muggle London, backs onto this street, and the entrance to Knockturn Alley
				lies in this street as well.You can use this as an Entrence to Wizard World.
