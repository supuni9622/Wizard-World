		"They make a fuss about Hogsmead, but I 
		assure you, Harry, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
		All right, the sweetshop's rather good,and Zonoko's Joke Shop's 
		frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrenking Shack's always worth a visit,but 
		really, Harry , apart from that, you're not missing anything"
